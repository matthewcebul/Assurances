<style="font-size:16px;">Ourlandia and Theirlandia have long contested control of Wave Island.<br>
According to Theirlandia:
 <li>Theirlandia's ancestors originally discovered Wave Island nearly 200 years ago, settling there before Ourlandia's ancestors first arrived;</li> 
 <li>Although Ourlandia now controls the island, Theirlandia has maintained deep cultural ties with the island's inhabitants to this day; </li>
 <li>Theirlandia therefore considers Wave Island to be an essential part of its national heritage.</li><br>
According to Ourlandia:
<li>Ourlandia's ancestors discovered Wave Island over 200 years ago, claiming the island for Ourlandia before Theirlandia's ancestors arrived;</li>
<li>Wave Island symbolizes Ourlandia's proud history of naval exploration;</li>
<li>Ourlandia therefore considers Wave Island to be an essential part of its national heritage.</li>
<p>

<p>
Theirlandia and Ourlandia are also engaged in an ongoing dispute over control of Sun Island; each country claims that Sun Island is an important part of its national heritage.
</p>

<p>
Theirlandia began the current dispute by demanding that Ourlandia give up control of Wave Island to Theirlandia, threatening to take the island by force if necessary. Theirlandia expresses regret that Ourlandia has ignored Theirlandia's repeated statements of its sovereign rights over Wave Island, and its prior requests that Ourlandia abandon its claim to the island. Theirlandia asserts that it now has no choice but to demand control of Wave Island.
<p>

<p>
Theirlandia further asserts that it does not desire any unnecessary conflict with Ourlandia and that control over Wave Island is the only source of controversy preventing harmonious relations between the two states; Theirlandia looks forward to a mutually beneficial peace once this issue is resolved.
<p>

<p>
Several years ago, Theirlandia had a similar territorial dispute with another state, "Otherlandia." Otherlandia made concessions, but Theirlandia proceeded to make additional demands; relations between the states have been tense since then.
<p>

<p>
Military experts believe that, in the event of war, the balance of military power between Ourlandia and Theirlandia significantly favors Theirlandia.
